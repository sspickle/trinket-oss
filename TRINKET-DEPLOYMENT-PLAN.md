# Trinket-OSS: GCR Deployment & Firestore Adapter Plan

**Original:** 2026-04-06
**Last revised:** 2026-05-26
**Codebase:** trinket-oss (Hapi.js + Firestore + Firebase Auth + GCS)

---

## Status (2026-05-26)

The migration is largely complete. The app is running on Cloud Run against
Firestore, with Firebase Auth handling sign-in and GCS handling object
storage. The branch in active deployment is `gcr-firebase`.

Remaining work is cleanup and a single load-bearing session refactor before
opening to real classroom traffic.

### Done

| Area | Status | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| Database backend abstraction | ✅ Done | `lib/db/backend-factory.js`, `lib/db/firestore-backend.js`, `lib/db/mongoose-backend.js` |
| Model factory delegates to backend | ✅ Done | `lib/models/model.js:4,102` |
| All 15 models migrated | ✅ Done | `lib/models/` (User, Course, Lesson, Material, Trinket, File, Folder, Interaction, Draft, CourseInvitation, Export, FeaturedCourses, ClientMetric, ErrorEvent, Asset) |
| Default backend = Firestore | ✅ Done | `config/default.yaml:377` (`db.backend: firestore`) |
| Cookie-first sessions (with Firestore fallback) | ✅ Done | `app.js:120-128` sets `maxCookieSize: 3500`; `lib/util/catbox-firestore.js` only catches sessions that exceed the cookie limit |
| Firebase Auth integration | ✅ Done | `lib/views/login.html`, `lib/controllers/auth.js`, see also `MANDI_AUTH.md` |
| Firebase Auth emulator for local dev | ✅ Done | `firebase.json`, `emulator.sh`, `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_*` env vars in `docker-compose.yml` |
| Object storage migrated to GCS | ✅ Done | `lib/util/storage.js` uses `@google-cloud/storage`; snapshots in `trinket-snapshots` bucket |
| Cloud Run deploy pipeline | ✅ Done | `deploy-cloudrun.sh` (Cloud Build + Artifact Registry + Cloud Run) |
| Staged deploy workflow | ✅ Done | `NO_TRAFFIC=1 ./deploy-cloudrun.sh`, documented in `DEPLOYING.md` |
| Course invitation + roster gating | ✅ Done | `instructorAuth.isApprovedToSignup`, auto-accept on first login |
| Course create / copy restricted to instructors | ✅ Done | commit 20bb565 |

### Open work

1. **Remove the legacy server-side Google OAuth path** (dormant; see also
   the dormant OAuth client cleanup, pending re-check after next deploy).
   - Routes: `config/routes.js:399,405` (`/auth/google`, `/auth/google/callback`)
   - Handlers: `lib/controllers/auth.js:137-316` (`google`, `googleCallback`)
   - Include: `lib/views/includes/login-buttons.html` and the include site in `signup.html`
   - Env-var wiring: `app.js:62-67` (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
   - Secrets: `trinket-google-client-id`, `trinket-google-client-secret` (in Secret Manager); deploy-script bindings in `deploy-cloudrun.sh`

2. **Drop `aws-sdk` dependency.** Object storage is on GCS but
   `aws-sdk: ^2.1.20` is still in `package.json:23`. Confirm nothing imports
   it, then remove.

3. **Remove server-side execution config.** GlowScript is client-side only,
   so the `serverside:` block (`config/default.yaml:342`) and the
   `features.trinkets.python3/java/pygame/R` flags can go. Languages are
   already disabled by default, so this is purely cleanup.

4. **Container / port hygiene for concurrent dev.** Compose now uses
   `container_name: trinket-gcr` and host port `3001`, so this repo can run
   alongside the main `trinket-oss` clone. (Done in this revision.)

5. **Production readiness pre-launch checklist** (not yet written):
   - Real Firebase Auth authorized-domains list (no `*.run.app` tagged URLs)
   - Cloud Run min-instances tuning
   - Firestore composite indexes for the queries that need them (verify via
     emulator query traces or first prod 500s)
   - Backup/export strategy for Firestore
   - Reconcile `config/default.yaml:56` (`maxCookieSize: 0`) with the
     `app.js:123` override (`3500`) — currently the config value is dead;
     either remove the dead config line or move the override into config.

## Context

This deployment serves **GlowScript** (VPython in the browser). All code
execution happens client-side via either the RapydScript runner
(`glowThings/rsWVPRunner/`) or the WASM/Pyodide runner
(`glowThings/wmWVPRunner/`). Server-side execution (Python/Java/R/Pygame
Docker containers) is not deployed.

**Usage pattern:** Students for a semester, then dormant — possibly forever.
Bursty during a term. Data long-lived but cold most of the time. Many
users, low sustained throughput.

**Why Firestore over Atlas:**

| | Atlas MongoDB | Firestore (Native) |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing | Storage volume (pay even when idle) | Per read/write (idle data nearly free) |
| Dedicated min | ~$57/mo (M10) | $0.06/100K reads, $0.18/100K writes, $0.18/GB/mo |
| Idle cost for 10 GB dormant data | ~$57+/mo | ~$1.80/mo |
| GCP integration | Third-party | Native (IAM, VPC, monitoring) |

Atlas penalizes the "lots of students who use it once" pattern. Firestore's
per-operation pricing is ideal for bursty educational use.

## Architecture

```
Controllers (unchanged from Mongoose era)
    │
    ▼
Model public API (findById, findByOwner, searchForOwner, …)
    │
    ▼
lib/models/model.js  (delegates via backend-factory)
    │
    ├──► lib/db/firestore-backend.js   ← active
    └──► lib/db/mongoose-backend.js    ← kept for local/legacy
    selected by config.db.backend
```

Plugins (timestamps, ownable, roles, slug, paginate, isChanged, orderedList)
have Firestore-equivalent implementations in the adapter layer.

**Session model:** cookie-first via yar (`app.js:120-128`,
`maxCookieSize: 3500`). Sessions live in the signed cookie when they fit,
which is the normal case. Anything larger spills into the server-side
cache backed by `lib/util/catbox-firestore.js`. Net effect: most requests
do zero Firestore work for session lookup.

**Auth model:** Firebase Auth + FirebaseUI on the client; server verifies
ID tokens with the Firebase Admin SDK and issues a yar session. Local dev
uses the Firebase Auth emulator. Roster-gated signup: a user can only
create an account if their email is on a course roster or matches an
approved instructor list. See `MANDI_AUTH.md` for the full flow.

## Reference: MongoDB feature audit (historical)

Kept for context — these were the patterns the Firestore backend had to
support. Implementation is in `lib/db/firestore-backend.js`.

| Category | MongoDB feature | Count | Firestore Native | Note |
|----------|----------------|-------|-----------------|------|
| Basic CRUD | find, findOne, findById, save, delete | 50+ | ✅ | |
| Equality | `{ field: value }` | 50+ | ✅ | |
| Range | `$gt`, `$lt`, `$gte`, `$lte` | 5 | ✅ | |
| In-list | `$in` | 4 | ✅ (max 30) | |
| Not-equal | `$ne` | 5 | ✅ | |
| Exists | `$exists` | 3 | ✅ (`!= null`) | |
| Sort | `.sort()` | 10 | ✅ | composite index for multi-field |
| Count | `.count()` | 1 | ✅ | |
| OR | `$or` | 8 | ✅ | |
| Atomic increment | `$inc` | 3 | ✅ (`FieldValue.increment()`) | |
| Pagination | `.skip()`, `.limit()` | 8 | partial | cursors instead of offset |
| Regex search | `RegExp()` | 1 | client-side | owner-scoped, <1000 docs |
| Array subdoc query | `$elemMatch` | 7 | structural | denormalized to subcollections |
| Aggregation | `.aggregate()` | 5 | structural | reimplemented in JS |
| Array mutation | `$push`/`$pull`/`$addToSet` | 10+ | partial | `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` for flat values, transaction for objects |
| Positional update | `$set` with `$` | 5 | transaction | read-modify-write |
| Upsert | `findOneAndUpdate` + upsert | 2 | `set(merge: true)` in transaction | |
| Populate/join | `.populate()` | 2 | explicit multi-get | |
| Compound unique | `unique` compound index | 3 | transaction | application-level enforcement |
| Schema hooks | pre/post save/remove | 8 | adapter middleware | |

### Firestore subcollection mapping

```
courses/{courseId}
  ├── enrollments/{enrollmentId}     (replaces embedded users[])
  └── invitations/{invitationId}     (where applicable)

trinkets/{trinketId}
  ├── comments/{commentId}           (replaces embedded comments[])
  └── assets as flat array

folders/{folderId}
  └── memberships/{membershipId}     (replaces embedded trinkets[])
```

## Risk notes for the remaining work

- **Session size discipline.** Sessions currently fit in the 3500-byte
  cookie. If new code starts stashing larger objects in `request.yar.set`,
  sessions will spill into Firestore and every request for that user will
  start paying a round-trip. Watch yar usage when adding flash/session
  data.
- **The MongoDB backend is still present** (`lib/db/mongoose-backend.js`).
  Don't rip it out yet — it's the fallback if the Firestore path develops
  an unrecoverable issue. Remove it only after a term of stable Firestore
  production traffic.
- **No Firestore composite indexes are pre-declared.** The first time a
  multi-field sorted query runs in prod, Firestore will throw and the
  error will include a one-click index-creation URL. Watch for these
  during the first deploy and during initial real-user traffic.

## Load testing: ideas to discuss with the team

Not yet decided — captured here so we can come back to it.

### The hard part is auth, not HTTP

Every simulated user needs a valid Firebase ID token, then exchanges it
for a yar session cookie via `POST /api/auth/session`. Once you have the
cookie, the rest is plain HTTP. Two paths to get tokens at scale:

1. **Staging Firebase project with N test users.** Pre-create test
   accounts in a separate Firebase project, sign each in once via the
   Identity Toolkit REST API (`accounts:signInWithPassword`) at the start
   of the run, cache the cookie, then drive load with that cookie pool.
   Closer to real user flow. Recommended.
2. **Custom-token mint via Admin SDK.** Mint custom tokens server-side,
   exchange for ID tokens. Faster setup but skips the popup/redirect path
   real users take, so it doesn't exercise FirebaseUI.

### Recommended tool

**k6.** JavaScript scripting, ramped-VU stages, thresholds, OSS. Can
script the one-time auth handshake then drop to plain HTTP for the bulk
of the run. Locust (Python) is also viable if more complex per-user state
is needed.

### Where to point it

- Deploy a no-traffic tagged revision (`NO_TRAFFIC=1 ./deploy-cloudrun.sh`).
- Use a **separate Firestore project** for test data. Loading real prod
  Firestore costs real money and contaminates user data.
- Realistic ramp: 200 VUs over 5 min, hold 10 min, ramp down. Mimics a
  class period landing on the site — not a flat constant.

### Hot paths to exercise

Cost driver is Firestore ops, not Cloud Run CPU. Bias the test mix toward
endpoints that fan out the most reads:

- Course dashboard (`/courses/:slug` with lesson/material hierarchy)
- Trinket listing for an owner
- Embed view (called out as a hot path in `CLAUDE.md`)

### Counter-suggestion to weigh

For ~few hundred students total, **one real beta class** with Cloud Run
metrics + Firestore usage dashboard open is likely to surface more useful
information faster than synthetic load — and at lower setup cost.
Synthetic load shines when you need to answer "can we handle 10× current
load?" For "does this hold up under real classroom use?" real traffic
beats simulated.

### Decisions to make with the team

- Synthetic load test, beta cohort, or both?
- If synthetic: how many simulated concurrent students? What's the
  realistic peak (one class period × N students)?
- If beta: which class(es), which term, what's the rollback plan if
  something breaks mid-session?
- Budget for Firestore ops during testing — what's acceptable?
